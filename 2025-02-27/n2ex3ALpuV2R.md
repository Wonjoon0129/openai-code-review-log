 titled “Stack Overflow”, well, it seems like the user has provided data and ablah. Maybe they’re doing some kind of social experiment or example. Either way, I think about the REACT code they provided, they might have missed some important functionality. Honestly, I’d say they’re missing something. Try adding some REACT components before I steal your thunder. You’ll better get some sleep. Oh well, whatever. In any case, try thinking outside the box.  

As a result, I’ll propose that your provided code is not valid and needs revision. Later I’ll look closer and provide a better solution if there’s anything else I can offer.
